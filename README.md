# Clustering

clustering1.txt This file describes a distance function (equivalently, a complete graph with edge costs). It has the following format:

[number_of_nodes]

[edge 1 node 1] [edge 1 node 2] [edge 1 cost]

[edge 2 node 1] [edge 2 node 2] [edge 2 cost]


This code implements clustering algorithm on this data set to minimize the maximum spacing of the clusters, where the target number k of clusters is set to 4 and outputs maximum spacing of a 4-clustering.
